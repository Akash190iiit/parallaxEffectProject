            <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes
                risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain
                climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
                <br><br>
                Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement:
                examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in
                knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for
                example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental
                constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses
                challenging experiences for learning.

            <p class="text">
                The most famous cycling race is the Tour de France. The Tour de France started in 1903. As cycling races
                became popular, different formats for racing were developed. These races involved individuals or teams,
                and they are contested in different ways. The races can be a one-day race, criterium, and time trail to
                multi-stage events. In time trial races, it requires the participants to ride against the clock.
                <br><br>
                The riders can participate individually or in teams. Organizations for cycling have strict rules on the
                bicycles that are used in the races.

                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness
                or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing.
                <br><br>
                The sport can be traced to the activities of French parachute inventor Pierre Lemoigne, who tow-launched
                his advanced round-parachute canopies in the 1950s. The ram-air-inflated cell structure originated in
                the early 1960s with the kite and parachute designs of the Canadian-born American inventor Domina
                Jalbert. These designs evolved into steerable rectangular parachutes with relatively high forward speed.
                It was soon found that they had sufficient glide performance to allow them to be launched from steep
                slopes as well as by the aircraft deployment usual for parachutists.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a
                board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the
                surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also
                be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in
                wave pools.
                <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
                the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on
                their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a
                wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
